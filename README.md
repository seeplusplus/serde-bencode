# serde-bencode
bencode for rust, utilizing serde

## Why? 

This is just a fun project, don't actually use this expecting it to work well (or even work at all).

Better alternatives to consider are [this](https://github.com/P3KI/bendy), and the alternatives mentioned in the "Known alternatives" section.

This is a project I'm undertaking in my free time to learn more about serde and Rust in general.
